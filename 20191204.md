# Preface
When the first editon of this book appeared in 1975,  the dominant intellectual focus was still subjectivity, feelings. That focus, the legacy of the 1960s, was preceded it. It declared,  in effect:"People are not robots. They are more than the sum total of their physiology. They have hopes, dreams, emotions. No two humans are alike--each has a special perspective , a unique way of perceiving the world.  And any view of humanity that ignores this subjective side is a distortion."

Yet, despite its value, the focus on feelings went too far. Like many other movements, what began as a reaction against an extreme view became an extreme view itself. The result of that extremism was the neglect of thinking. This book was designed to answer that neglect. The introduction to the first editon explained its rationale as follows:
	*The emphasis on subjectivity served to correct a dangerous oversimplification. But it is the kind of reaction that cannot be sustained for long without causing an even worse situation --the neglect of thinking. Worse of hucksters and demagogues stand ready with the rich resources of psychology to play upon our emotions and subconscious needs to persuade us that superficial is profoud, harmful is beneficial, evil is virtuous. And feelings are especially vulnerable to such manipulatin.
	secondly, because in virtually every important area of moder life--law, medicion, goverment, education, science, business, and community affairs--we are beset with serious problems and complex issuses that thoughtful consideration of verious conclusions or actions, and judicious selection of the best conclusion or most appropriate action.....
	Today's college student has been conditoned not to undervalue subjectivity, but to overvalue it. And so he does not need to have his feelings indulged. Rather, he needs to be taught how to sort out his feelings , decide to what extent they have been shaped by external influences, and evaluate them carefully when they conflict among themselves or with the feelings of others. In short, he needs to be taught to think critically. Thought as mutually exclusive, to force a choice between them. If we focus on one, then in their view we must reject the other. But this is mistaken. Feeling and thought are perfectly complementary. Feeling, being clusions, And thought, being more deliberate, provides a way to identify the best and most appropriate feeling. Both are natural. 
	Thinking, however, is less automatic than feeling. To do it well demands a systematic approach and guided practice.*
The general attitude towards thinking has changed considerably since the mid-1970s. The view that critical thinking is an important skill to which education should give prominence is no longer a minority view. Hundreds of voices have joined the chorus calling for the additon of critical thinking. There is little disagreement that the challenges of the new millennium demand minds that can move beyond feelings to clear, impartial, critical problem solving and decision making.
